# Modal Layout

WIP

:construction: :construction: :construction:

*Do not use this repository until it has a stable version*


## Configuration

1. Import the modal layout's app to your theme's dependencies in the `manifest.json`, for example:

```jsonc
{
  "vtex.modal-layout": "0.x"
}
```

2. Now you can use the two blocks that the `modal-layout` app export. You have to create your `modal-layout` block and put him as a child of the `modal-trigger` block:

```jsonc
{
  "modal-trigger#preview-shelf": {
    "children": [
      "modal-layout#preview-shelf",
      "product-summary-buy-button"
    ]
  },
  "modal-layout#preview-shelf": {
    "props": {
      "title": "This is the title of the product preview",
      "blockClass": "klynger"
    },
    "children": [
      "all-my-children-elements-of-modal",
      "product-images"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Modal
